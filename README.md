This is a repository containing the key tools for reproducing the analysis for Ribothrypsis.

Preprocessing of the sequencing data has been done with [ClipSeqTools](https://github.com/mnsmar/clipseqtools).

Analysis tools are written in `Go` and among others depend on `biogo`, `htsdb` and `wig` libraries.
